# CodexLight Implementation Status

[Documentation Index](README.md) | [Project Home](../README.en.md) | [中文实现说明](当前实现说明.md)

This document is the technical handoff for the current CodexLight implementation. The root READMEs remain the primary user-facing source of truth.

## Desktop Bridge

Entry point: `Bridge/codex_light_monitor.py`

Primary inputs:

- `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- `~/.codex/logs_2.sqlite`

State mapping:

| Event | State |
| --- | --- |
| `task_started` | `RED` |
| `agent_message`, `agent_reasoning`, `token_count` | `RED` |
| `function_call`, `function_call_output` | `RED` |
| Tool payload contains approval, permission, or user-input markers | `YELLOW` |
| `task_complete` | `GREEN` |
| `turn_aborted` | `GREEN` |

An active turn does not become green because of `item/completed` or a quiet timeout. `quiet_timeout` is a fallback only when no active turn exists.

When serial opens, the Bridge waits two seconds, sends `MODE WIRED` for serial-only operation or `MODE AUTO` when UDP is also enabled, and sends the current state. Serial and UDP states repeat every two seconds as firmware heartbeats.

UDP begins with broadcast discovery. After receiving a matching `HELLO`, the Bridge records the MAC and IP in the Git-ignored `Bridge/config.local.json` and prefers unicast.

## Firmware

Entry point: `Firmware/src/main.cpp`

Modules:

- `src/config_portal.cpp`: non-blocking WiFiManager provisioning
- `src/led.cpp`: three independent Adafruit NeoPixel outputs
- `include/config.h`: user-facing constants

Each loop iteration:

1. Parses USB serial commands.
2. Calls WiFiManager `process()`.
3. Maintains UDP listening and `HELLO` discovery packets.
4. Selects an active transport from the configured mode and fresh heartbeats.
5. Updates the connection animation or actual LED state.

There is no infinite Wi-Fi wait and no `while (!Serial)`, so standalone and wired operation remain available without a network.

## Transport Modes

- `WIRED`: considers `lastWiredPacketMs` only.
- `WIRELESS`: considers `lastWirelessPacketMs` only.
- `AUTO`: accepts both and prefers a fresh wired heartbeat.

The mode is stored in NVS using Preferences namespace `codexlight`, key `transport`. The source default is `WIRED`. A normal firmware upload does not erase NVS.

## Heartbeat and LED Timing

- Bridge heartbeat interval: 2 seconds
- Firmware link timeout: 6 seconds
- Disconnected blink half-period: 500 ms
- Connection animation duration: 2 seconds
- Connection animation half-period: 250 ms

The LED driver uses `NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800`, matching the reference project. Every state transition writes all three independent LED outputs so inactive LEDs are explicitly cleared.

## Wi-Fi Provisioning

WiFiManager opens `CodexLight-XXXX` at `192.168.4.1` when no usable credentials exist. The current AP password is `123456789`.

- `WIFI_CONFIG` calls `startConfigPortal()`.
- `CLEAR_WIFI` resets saved settings, disconnects, and reopens the portal.

The ESP32-C3 ultimately operates as a Wi-Fi station on the user's 2.4 GHz LAN. The phone-facing AP is a provisioning mechanism, not the permanent desktop-to-device network.

## Protocol

Serial commands:

```text
GREEN
RED
YELLOW
PING
STATUS
MODE WIRED
MODE WIRELESS
MODE AUTO
WIFI_CONFIG
CLEAR_WIFI
```

UDP states:

```text
CODEXLIGHT/1 GREEN
CODEXLIGHT/1 RED
CODEXLIGHT/1 YELLOW
CODEXLIGHT/1 PING
```

Discovery:

```text
CODEXLIGHT/1 HELLO mac=<MAC> mode=<MODE>
```

## Removed Legacy Behavior

The current implementation no longer uses:

- Hard-coded `wifi_secrets.h` credentials
- A custom blocking configuration page
- UDP token pairing or `PAIR_SET`
- FastLED global multi-controller refresh
- Ordinary `item/completed` logs as a full task-completion signal

## Verification

```powershell
python -B -c "import ast,pathlib; ast.parse(pathlib.Path('Bridge/codex_light_monitor.py').read_text(encoding='utf-8')); print('OK')"

cd Firmware
pio run -j 1
```

The latest NeoPixel firmware build completed successfully. It used approximately 65.5% flash and 12.3% RAM; exact values may change with dependency versions.

## Maintenance Rules

- Keep root and subdirectory documentation synchronized in Chinese and English.
- Do not commit `Bridge/config.local.json`, Wi-Fi credentials, or device-specific IP addresses.
- Preserve non-blocking serial operation when modifying provisioning.
- Treat `task_complete` and `turn_aborted` as the definitive green transitions.
- Rebuild firmware after changing GPIOs, pixel order, or provisioning constants.
